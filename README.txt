I have included the GOLOANG code here.  I started learning GO a couple of weeks ago and thought this would be a
good opportunity to use instead of Java.  I am able to get something up and running and deployed much quicker than in
Java, so it is handy for these type of tests.

The important file to look at is employee-structrure.go.

I am hosting this app in Googles Appengine for you here:

If you want to see how the app handles errors (not the prettiest,
 as I output console error logs in-situ to the screen) see an alternative deploy here:
